# Computer-Vision-Number-Classifier
Small project to attempt to get some experience using tensorflow and opencv in conjunction to classify written numbers as viewed from my webcam. Using the keras sequential model and the MNIST dataset example from the TensorFlow tutorials.

Requires OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Numpy. 

Optionally matplotlib may be installed for testing and viewing images with its image viewer as it is better suited than the OpenCV viewer in some cases.
